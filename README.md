nebulousChat
============
nebulousChat is a work-in-progress chat client with nested messages. 
It is written in Python and will eventually have a wxPython GUI.

Usage
-----
`python server.py n` launches a server on port `n`.

`python client.py your.domain.or.ip port` launches a client 
which will connect to `your.domain.or.ip:port`.

Of course `your.domain.or.ip` can be `localhost`.
